# IMU-ROS Simulation Package
> This package is meant to be used alongside a simulator (e.g. Unity...). The noise model algorithm adds noise to a "true" IMU reading (linear acceleration, angular velocity) 
to produce a "real" IMU reading. The noise added should be unpredictable. The ultimate goal of this package is to create a more realistic simulation.
